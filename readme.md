# Violet Void Theme

Welcome to **Violet Void Theme**, a visually appealing theme designed for developers who prefer a dark and elegant interface. The theme brings a calm, focused aesthetic to your editor, with carefully chosen color schemes that are easy on the eyes, especially during long coding sessions.

But Violet Void goes beyond just coloring your code editor. It extends its vibrant and harmonious color scheme to **Windows Terminal**, **Windows 11**, **Obsidian.md**, **Firefox**, **Thunderbird**, **Discord**, **Telegram**, **Window Manager glazewm** and more. With Violet Void, your entire digital workspace can benefit from a cohesive and immersive visual experience.

## üîß Installation

The theme will soon be available in your favorite editor's marketplace. Once published, installation will be just a few clicks away.

In addition to the theme, I will also release a **PowerShell module** that integrates seamlessly with the Violet Void theme, enhancing your terminal experience with custom icons and glowing effects.

I'm also working on a **full solution** that includes live wallpapers, terminal integrations, and other customizations. This solution will be available for installation via popular package managers like **winget**, **choco**, and **scoop**. This will allow you to easily install the entire Violet Void experience across your system.

Stay tuned for more updates as I work towards finalizing the theme and ensuring it provides the best user experience.

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Status

At the moment, I'm working extensively on the **first release**, ensuring that it meets the highest standards for usability, aesthetics, and performance. This includes refining the color palette, improving terminal integration, and perfecting the live wallpaper and other custom features. My goal is to provide a polished and stable version that users can enjoy from day one.
